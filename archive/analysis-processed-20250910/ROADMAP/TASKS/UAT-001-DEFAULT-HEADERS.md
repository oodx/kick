# UAT-001: DEFAULT HEADERS IMPLEMENTATION
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Blocks MVP Certification)  
**Source**: Horus Executive UAT Assessment - FEATHER_USABILITY_01.md  
**Component**: Configuration System  

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL BUSINESS IMPACT**: Default headers configured in TOML files are completely ignored during HTTP requests, breaking fundamental configuration contracts for executives using authentication tokens, corporate identity headers, and rate limiting.

## Problem Statement
Current behavior:
1. Configuration loads `[client.default_headers]` from TOML ✅
2. Headers are parsed and stored without error ✅  
3. Headers are displayed in debug output ✅
4. **Headers are completely discarded during HTTP requests** ❌

## Executive Impact
```toml
[client.default_headers]
"Authorization" = "Bearer corp-executive-token"
"X-Corporate-ID" = "Executive-Division-Alpha"
```

**Expected**: These headers automatically included in every request  
**Reality**: Executives discover their critical business requests go out WITHOUT authentication

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Default headers from configuration are automatically included in all HTTP requests
- [ ] Default headers can be overridden by explicit request headers
- [ ] Headers are properly encoded and formatted according to HTTP specs
- [ ] Debug output shows which headers came from config vs explicit
- [ ] Integration test demonstrates end-to-end header inclusion

## Technical Requirements
1. Modify `ApiClient::execute_request()` to merge default headers with request headers
2. Implement header precedence: explicit > default
3. Add validation for header key/value formats  
4. Update request building logic to include configured headers
5. Add integration test with real HTTP requests

## Definition of Done
- Default headers functionality works end-to-end
- All existing tests pass
- New integration test validates header inclusion
- Documentation updated with header precedence rules
- Ready for Horus re-certification

## Business Value
**HIGH**: Core configuration system functionality - required for any business-grade API client
