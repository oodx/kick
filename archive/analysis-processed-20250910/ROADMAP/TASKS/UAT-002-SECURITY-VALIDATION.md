# UAT-002: SECURITY VALIDATION ENFORCEMENT
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: P1 (High - Security & Documentation Integrity)  
**Source**: Horus Executive UAT Assessment - FEATHER_USABILITY_01.md  
**Component**: Security Module  

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL SECURITY GAP**: SSRF protection code exists with comprehensive validation, tests exist expecting IP blocking, feature flags exist, but **NONE OF IT IS ACTUALLY ENFORCED** creating false security promises.

## Problem Statement
Current security theater:
1. `UrlValidator` module with SSRF protection logic ✅
2. Tests expecting private IP blocking exist ✅
3. `strict-security` feature flag properly defined ✅
4. **CLI and library completely bypass all security validation** ❌

## Executive Impact
```bash
# This request SHOULD be blocked in strict mode but succeeds:
kick get "http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin"
kick get "http://192.168.1.1/sensitive"
```

**Expected**: Requests blocked when `strict-security` feature enabled  
**Reality**: Executives using production clients have false sense of security protection

## Decision Point
Choose implementation approach:

### Option A: Remove Security Claims (Recommended for MVP)
- Remove SSRF documentation claims
- Remove non-functional security tests  
- Keep flexible security model (Edgar's design working correctly)
- Focus on core HTTP client functionality

### Option B: Implement Full Security Enforcement
- Wire `UrlValidator::validate()` into request pipeline
- Enforce security policies based on feature flags
- Fix failing security tests
- Add security validation to all request paths

## Acceptance Criteria (Option A - MVP Focus)
- [ ] Remove false security claims from documentation
- [ ] Remove or update failing security tests
- [ ] Clarify that security model is "flexible by default"
- [ ] Document that strict security is planned for future release

## Acceptance Criteria (Option B - Full Security)
- [ ] `UrlValidator::validate()` called in request pipeline
- [ ] `strict-security` feature flag properly enforced
- [ ] Private IP blocking works when enabled
- [ ] Localhost blocking works when enabled  
- [ ] All security tests pass
- [ ] Security documentation accurate

## Technical Requirements

### Option A (MVP):
1. Update README security section to reflect current reality
2. Remove or comment out failing security tests
3. Add security roadmap section for future enhancements
4. Verify default flexible behavior works correctly

### Option B (Full):
1. Integrate `UrlValidator` into `DriverClient` or `ApiClient`
2. Add security validation before HTTP requests  
3. Implement feature flag checking in validation pipeline
4. Fix all failing security tests
5. Add integration tests for security enforcement

## Definition of Done
- No false security promises in documentation
- All tests pass (no failing security tests)  
- Clear documentation of current security model
- Ready for Horus re-certification

## Business Value
**MEDIUM-HIGH**: Eliminates false security promises that could endanger production deployments
