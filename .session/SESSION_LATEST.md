**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Status**: Security Hardened + REST Complete + Feature Gap Analysis ✅  
**Strategy**: Production-ready security foundation with roadmap for enterprise features

## 🎯 CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

### ✅ MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS THIS SESSION

**🔒 CRITICAL SECURITY HARDENING COMPLETE:**
- **Fixed --save parameter vulnerability** - Path traversal protection added
- **Created src/sec/mod.rs security module** - Centralized security validators (235 lines)
- **SSRF Protection** - URL validation blocks private IPs, localhost, malicious schemes
- **Header Injection Protection** - CRLF injection prevention, length limits
- **File Path Sanitization** - Comprehensive path traversal prevention
- **All security tests passing** - 15/15 unit tests including 3 new security tests

**🚀 COMPLETE REST METHOD IMPLEMENTATION:**
- **PUT method** - `kick put <url> --data <json>` ✅
- **DELETE method** - `kick delete <url>` ✅  
- **PATCH method** - `kick patch <url> --data <json>` ✅
- **All methods include security validation** - URL/header/path protection
- **Real-world testing verified** - httpbin.org endpoints working perfectly

**📋 COMPREHENSIVE FEATURE GAP ANALYSIS:**
- **China the Summary Chicken** performed detailed src_ref/ vs src/ comparison
- **Found massive missing features**: 330+ lines of streaming, 7-hook plugin system
- **Identified strategic advantages**: 235-line security module that src_ref lacks
- **Created implementation roadmap** with effort estimates (12-16 days total)

### 🏗️ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE STATUS

**✅ PRODUCTION-READY FEATURES:**
- Complete HTTP client: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH with JSON support
- Security-hardened CLI with --local downloads, --save protection
- Plugin system with 4 working hooks (PreRequest, PostRequest, OnError, OnRetry)
- Release binary: `./target/release/kick` (working, tested)
- Comprehensive test infrastructure: unit tests + real endpoint validation

**🌐 VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY:**
- ✅ SSRF protection blocks malicious URLs
- ✅ Header injection prevention working
- ✅ File operations secured against path traversal
- ✅ All REST methods functional with real APIs
- ✅ Plugin logging and verbose modes working
- ✅ Download to both XDG and local directories

## 🔍 FEATURE GAP ANALYSIS RESULTS

### 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM CHINA'S ANALYSIS
**Location**: `.eggs/egg.1.feature-gap-analysis.txt`

**TIER 1: MISSING CRITICAL FEATURES (HIGH VALUE)**
1. **Advanced Plugin System** - Only 4/7 hooks implemented (missing PreResponse, PostResponse, OnStream)
2. **Streaming Infrastructure** - 330+ lines completely missing from src_ref/
3. **Storage Management** - 292+ lines of sophisticated file features stubbed

**CURRENT ADVANTAGES (KEEP THESE!):**
- **Security Module** - 235 lines of protection that src_ref completely lacks
- **Production CLI** - Working REST client with comprehensive security
- **Test Coverage** - Real-world validation with security test suite

### 📊 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP PRIORITIES

**🚀 PHASE 1: Streaming Foundation (Week 1 - 4-5 days)**
- Implement BufferedStream, ChunkedStream, RateLimitedStream
- Add response_to_stream conversion utilities
- Enable large file processing capabilities

**🔥 PHASE 2: Enhanced Plugin System (Week 2 - 3-4 days)**  
- Add PreResponse/PostResponse hooks with response mutation
- Implement OnStream hook for data processing
- Add RateLimitPlugin as reference implementation

**📁 PHASE 3: Storage Sophistication (Week 3 - 2-3 days)**
- Implement save_stream with progress tracking
- Add FileMetadata, StorageStats, StreamingFileWriter
- Professional file management capabilities

## 🛡️ SECURITY ANALYSIS RESULTS

### 🔒 EDGAR'S SECURITY ASSESSMENT
**Location**: `.eggs/security_hardening_analysis.md`

**✅ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED:**
1. **Unsafe File Operations** (--save parameter) - Path traversal protection ✅
2. **Header Injection** - CRLF prevention implemented ✅
3. **SSRF Protection** - URL validation with private IP blocking ✅

**📋 REMAINING SECURITY BACKLOG:**
- TLS hardening (non-blocking for MVP)
- Plugin security sandbox (architectural change)
- Script download isolation (documented in SECURITY_BACKLOG.md)

**🎯 SECURITY POSTURE:** Upgraded from MEDIUM-HIGH risk to LOW-MEDIUM risk
**Production Status:** ✅ SAFE TO DEPLOY for basic MVP use cases

## 🔧 CURRENT TODO STATUS

### ✅ COMPLETED TASKS
- Review codebase structure and verify China's findings
- Add --local flag for downloads to ./.downloads/ directory  
- Fix critical security vulnerability in --save parameter
- Create src/sec/mod.rs module for security helpers
- Fix header injection vulnerability (blocking feature)
- Fix inadequate URL validation - SSRF protection (blocking feature)
- Add PUT HTTP method support
- Add DELETE HTTP method support
- Add PATCH HTTP method support
- Enable storage and streaming modules in lib.rs

### 🚧 PENDING TASKS (Next Session Priorities)
1. **Fix streaming module compatibility** - Hyper version conflicts need resolution
2. **Implement BufferedStream** for memory-efficient streaming
3. **Add OnStream hook** to plugin system  
4. **Implement response_to_stream** conversion utility
5. **Add PreResponse/PostResponse hooks** to plugin system
6. **Implement progress tracking** for downloads
