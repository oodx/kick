# Progressive Layering Strategy

Based on working driver patterns and comprehensive src_ref functionality.

## Phase 1: Fix Core Modules (Current Priority)
**Goal:** Get basic compilation working using proven driver patterns

**Tasks:**
- Fix `client/mod.rs` using driver's HTTP client pattern
- Fix `plugin/mod.rs` using driver's simplified plugin trait
- Fix `error/mod.rs` (should be mostly working)
- Enable modules in `lib.rs` one by one
- Add basic tests for each module as we fix it

## Phase 2: Add Builder Pattern & Advanced Client
**Goal:** Layer in the sophisticated API from main_rs.rs

**Tasks:**
- Add `ApiClientBuilder` with fluent configuration
- Implement `download_file`, `download_json` methods
- Add custom headers and user-agent support
- Integrate config loading/saving
- Add comprehensive client tests

## Phase 3: Restore Storage Operations
**Goal:** XDG-compliant file management with streaming

**Tasks:**
- Fix `storage/mod.rs` using proven async patterns
- Add `save_string`, `load_string`, `list_files` methods
- Implement storage stats and cleanup functionality
- Add storage integration tests

## Phase 4: Advanced Streaming & Rate Limiting
**Goal:** Memory-efficient streaming with backpressure

**Tasks:**
- Fix `streaming/mod.rs` with pin-project patterns
- Add rate limiting streams
- Implement progress tracking callbacks
- Add `collect_stream` and streaming utilities
- Add streaming performance tests

## Phase 5: Comprehensive Plugin System
**Goal:** Full 7-hook plugin architecture from China's analysis

**Tasks:**
- Extend plugin trait with all hooks (Pre/PostRequest, Pre/PostResponse, etc.)
- Add `LoggingPlugin`, `RateLimitPlugin` from src_ref
- Implement plugin configuration and initialization
- Add plugin lifecycle management
- Add plugin integration tests

## Phase 6: Full Main.rs Example Suite
**Goal:** Comprehensive documentation through working examples

**Tasks:**
- Restore all 7 examples from main_rs.rs
- Add custom plugin example (`CustomMetricsPlugin`)
- Integration testing through examples
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation generation

## Strategy Benefits:
1. **Incremental Risk:** Each phase builds on proven foundations
2. **Continuous Testing:** Every phase includes test validation
3. **Early Wins:** Basic functionality first, advanced features later
4. **Rollback Safety:** Can stop at any phase and have working code
