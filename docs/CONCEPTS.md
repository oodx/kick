# Core Concepts and Implementation Strategies for 'Kick' Modular API Client

This document outlines the fundamental patterns, strategies, and approaches to guide developers in implementing tasks for the 'Kick' modular API client. Adhering to these concepts will ensure consistency, maintainability, and robustness of the codebase.

## 1. Modularity and Separation of Concerns

**Concept:** Each major component (Client, Config, Plugin, Storage, Streaming, Error) is designed as a distinct module with a clear, single responsibility.

**Strategy:**
*   **Encapsulation:** Modules should expose only what is necessary for external interaction and hide internal implementation details.
*   **Loose Coupling:** Minimize direct dependencies between modules. Communication should primarily happen through well-defined interfaces (traits) or shared, immutable data structures.
*   **Clear APIs:** Public functions and structs should have clear, concise names and well-documented purposes.

**Example:** The `ApiClient` focuses solely on HTTP request execution and coordination with other managers. It doesn't directly handle configuration parsing or file storage; it delegates these responsibilities to `Config`, `StorageManager`, and `StreamHandler`.

## 2. Asynchronous Programming with Tokio

**Concept:** The client is built on `tokio` for asynchronous I/O operations, enabling non-blocking execution and efficient resource utilization.

**Strategy:**
*   **`async`/`await`:** Use `async` functions and `await` expressions for all I/O-bound operations (network requests, file system access, streaming).
*   **`tokio::spawn`:** For long-running or independent tasks that shouldn't block the current execution flow, use `tokio::spawn` to run them on a separate task.
*   **Error Handling in Async:** Ensure `Result` is consistently used for fallible async operations, propagating errors up the call stack.

**Example:** `ApiClient::execute_request` and `StorageManager::save_bytes` are `async` functions, and `tokio::task::spawn` is used for the `hyper` connection task.

## 3. Plugin-Oriented Architecture

**Concept:** The system is designed to be extensible through a flexible plugin mechanism, allowing custom logic to be injected at various points in the request/response lifecycle.

**Strategy:**
*   **Trait-Based Extension:** Define clear traits (e.g., `Plugin`) that specify the interface for custom logic.
*   **Hook Points:** Identify specific, well-defined "hook points" (`PluginHook` enum) where plugins can execute their logic.
*   **Immutability (where possible):** Plugins should ideally operate on immutable data or mutable references (`&mut T`) where necessary, minimizing shared mutable state. If shared mutable state is required, use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for thread-safe access.
*   **Contextual Information:** Provide plugins with relevant contextual information (`PluginContext`) at each hook point.

**Example:** The `Plugin` trait defines methods like `handle_pre_request` and `handle_error`. The `PluginManager` dispatches calls to registered plugins based on the active `PluginHook`.

## 4. Robust Error Handling with `thiserror`

**Concept:** Provide clear, descriptive, and categorized errors to facilitate debugging and graceful error recovery.

**Strategy:**
*   **Custom Error Enum:** Define a single, comprehensive `ApiError` enum using `thiserror` to represent all possible error conditions.
*   **Specific Variants:** Avoid generic "unknown error" types where possible. Create specific variants for common error categories (HTTP, IO, Config, Plugin, Storage, etc.).
*   **Contextual Data:** Include relevant data within error variants (e.g., `hyper::StatusCode` for `HttpStatus` errors, `String` messages for `Config` errors).
*   **`Result` Type Alias:** Use `pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, ApiError>;` for convenience and consistency.
*   **`?` Operator:** Leverage the `?` operator for concise error propagation.

**Example:** `ApiError::HttpStatus { status: hyper::StatusCode }` clearly indicates an HTTP status error, while `ApiError::Io(#[from] std::io::Error)` provides the underlying IO error.

## 5. Configuration Management

**Concept:** Centralized and persistent configuration management using `serde` and `toml` for easy serialization/deserialization.

**Strategy:**
*   **Single `Config` Struct:** Consolidate all application settings into a single `Config` struct, with nested structs for logical grouping (e.g., `ClientConfig`, `StorageConfig`).
*   **Default Values:** Provide sensible default values for all configuration fields using `#[derive(Default)]` or `impl Default for Config`.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization:** Use `serde` with `toml` for reading/writing configuration files, enabling human-readable and editable settings.
*   **XDG Base Directory Specification:** Store configuration files in standard OS-specific locations (e.g., `~/.config/modular-api-client/config.toml` on Linux) using the `dirs` crate.

**Example:** `Config::load()` and `Config::save()` handle reading from and writing to `config.toml`, and `Config::default()` provides initial values.

## 6. Resource Management and Cleanup

**Concept:** Efficiently manage system resources (file handles, network connections, temporary files) and ensure proper cleanup.

**Strategy:**
*   **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):** Leverage Rust's ownership system to ensure resources are automatically released when they go out of scope.
*   **Explicit Cleanup:** For resources that require explicit management (e.g., temporary files), provide dedicated cleanup methods (e.g., `StorageManager::cleanup_temp_files`).
*   **Configuration-Driven Cleanup:** Allow cleanup behavior to be configured (e.g., `cleanup_on_exit` in `StorageConfig`).

**Example:** `StorageManager::cleanup_temp_files()` is called at the end of `main.rs` if configured, ensuring temporary files are removed.

## 7. Streaming Data Handling

**Concept:** Process large data payloads efficiently without loading them entirely into memory, using asynchronous streams.

**Strategy:**
*   **`futures::Stream` Trait:** Utilize the `Stream` trait for representing sequences of asynchronous data.
*   **Stream Adapters:** Implement custom stream adapters (e.g., `BufferedStream`, `ChunkedStream`, `RateLimitedStream`, `ProgressStream`) to transform and process data chunks.
*   **Backpressure:** Design streaming components to handle backpressure, preventing producers from overwhelming consumers.
*   **Timeout:** Apply timeouts to stream operations to prevent indefinite waits.

**Example:** `StreamHandler` provides methods to convert `hyper::Response` bodies into `Stream`s and offers various stream processing utilities.

## 8. Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Test-First Approach

**Concept:** Write tests before or alongside the code they are meant to validate, driving the design and ensuring correctness.

**Strategy:**
*   **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual functions or small components in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify the interaction between multiple components or modules.
*   **Mocking/Faking:** Use mocking libraries (e.g., `mockito`, `wiremock`) or custom fakes for external dependencies (HTTP servers, file system) to make tests fast and reliable.
*   **Regression Tests:** Add tests for bugs as they are discovered to prevent future regressions.

**Example:** For `M1.3: Basic ApiClient Tests`, tests should be written to verify `get` and `post_json` behavior against a controlled mock environment.

## 9. Documentation and Examples

**Concept:** Provide clear, comprehensive documentation and practical examples to make the library easy to understand and use.

**Strategy:**
*   **Rustdoc:** Use Rustdoc comments (`///`) for all public items (structs, enums, traits, functions, modules).
*   **Module-Level Docs:** Provide `//!` comments at the top of each module to explain its purpose.
*   **Examples in Docs:** Include small, runnable examples directly within Rustdoc comments where appropriate.
*   **Standalone Examples:** Maintain a `examples/` directory with more complex, runnable examples demonstrating various features.

**Example:** Every public function should have a clear description of its purpose, arguments, and return values.

## 10. Immutability and Shared State

**Concept:** Prefer immutable data structures and shared references (`&T`) over mutable ones (`&mut T`) to reduce complexity and prevent concurrency issues. When mutability is necessary for shared state, use explicit synchronization primitives.

**Strategy:**
*   **`Arc` for Shared Ownership:** Use `Arc<T>` for multiple owners of data that needs to be shared across threads.
*   **`Mutex` or `RwLock` for Shared Mutability:** When shared data needs to be mutable, wrap it in `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for exclusive access or `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for multiple readers/single writer access.
*   **Atomic Types:** For simple, primitive shared counters or flags, use `std::sync::atomic` types.

**Example:** The `PluginManager` holds `Arc<dyn Plugin>` instances, allowing multiple parts of the application to refer to the same plugin without ownership issues. The `CustomMetricsPlugin` uses `AtomicU64` for its counters.

This comprehensive set of concepts will serve as a guiding principle for all development efforts on the 'Kick' modular API client.
